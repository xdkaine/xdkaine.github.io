<h1> High School Goals </h1>
<p> Some of my goals during my High School Career is to accomplish more than 100 hours of community service. 
  This would be a massive feat for me to achieve this. 
  I thought it would be great for me to accomplish this goal and give back to the community.
  I do have other purposes, such as achieving a perfect grade point average.
  Lastly, I want to work on my study habits and become more active in studying and not waiting until the last moment.
  I also styled this using the file "styles.css"! It's a fantastic tool!
</p>
