<h1 style="color:red;"> My High School Goals! </h1>
<p style="font-size:300%;"> Some of my goals during my High School Career is to accomplish more than 100 hours of community service. This would be a massive feat for me to achieve this. I thought it would be great for me to accomplish this goal and give back to the community. I do have other purposes, such as achieving a perfect grade point average. I do want to work on my study habits and become more active in studying and not waiting until the last moment. Lastly, one thing I would like to do is increase my social activity to become more communicative instead of staying home and going out only once and a while with friends. I also styled this using the file "styles.css"! It's a fantastic tool!
