<h1 style="color:red;"> My High School Goals! </h1>
<p style="font-size:300%;"> Some of my goals during my High School Career is to accomplish more than 100 hours of community service. This would be a huge feat for me to accomplish this. I thought it would be great for me to accomplish this goal and give back to the community. 
I do have other goals such as accomplishing a perfect grade point average. I do want to work on my study habits and become more active into studying and not waiting till the last moment. Lastly, one thing I would like to do is increase my social activity to become more social instead of staying home and going out only once and a while with friends. 
I also styled this using the file "styles.css"! its amazing tool!
