  My name is Tommy, and I play the Tenor Saxophone. I have marched in the Ayala Band and Colorguard for two years. 
  My friend is Evan Siriban, and he is currently sitting next to me.
  He is writing a paragraph about himself just like me. 
  This has been an entertaining and enjoyable learning experience for both of us.
  Using HTML and Learning how to use CSS has been an interesting and learning experience for the both of us.
